        <h3>Welcome to Soduku for kids!</h3>
        <p>Anyone can play Sudoku, including you! Are you ready to learn the rules?</p>
        <p>Sudoku rules for beginners:
            <ol>
                <li>Only use the numbers 1 to 4 which will turn into the group of pictures you choose,</li>
                <li>Avoid trying to guess the solution to the puzzle,</li>
                <li>Only use each number once in each row, column, & grid,</li>
                <li>Use the process of elimination as a tactic,</li>
                <li>Use cross-hatching and penciling in techniques.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p>By following these simple rules, you should be able to work out the solution to just about any Sudoku puzzle that you encounter. 
            If you find that a puzzle is proving impossible to solve; it is probably the difficulty level of the puzzle, that is the problem, 
            and not because you are not following the rules correctly.</p>
